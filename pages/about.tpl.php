<p>Throughout our lives, we encounter challenges that strain our ability to cope. Like a storm at sea, these experiences can be overwhelming, and threaten to leave us immobilized.  At these times, we can respond as a skillful sailor, adjusting course and adapting new methods to navigate even the most formidable waters.</p>

<p>There are ways to manage the most intense experiences:  death, separation, divorce, job loss, depression, anxiety, family dysfunction, relationship issues, loneliness.  Each person and each situation is unique, requiring a diversity of creative approaches. </p>

<p>As a nurse psychotherapist I conduct a practice of therapy and consultation with the goal of assisting individuals, families, and groups to progress more effectively through demanding phases of life.  I strive to form a relationship with those seeking my assistance that allows for the exploration and understanding of the presenting issues, and the development of the capacity to negotiate the storms of life transitions.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Following a career as a community health nurse in Germany and as a nurse practitioner in a variety of settings, then as a clinical nurse specialist in oncology and later as a psychiatric liaison at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) I became an educator and the director of a graduate nursing program at the University of Maryland. I entered the field of psychotherapy as the co-director of the children’s program and grief therapist at the St. Francis Center, formerly the center for loss and grief in Washington, DC.</p>

<p>I have developed and currently facilitate a private practice of psychotherapy, consultation, and supervision.  I am an educator, author, lecturer, and qualitative researcher.  I provide psychotherapy for children, adolescents, adults, couples, families and groups. I believe that the relationship between the therapist and client is pivotal, and I strive to facilitate the development of  the trust that is the essential foundation for the work that is to be done together.  I also maintain that the setting for the practice of psychotherapy is significant.  I have a <a href="office.html">residential practice</a> that allows me to incorporate space, light, music, a variety of projective tools, as well as the out-of doors to promote the development of insight and change.</p>
